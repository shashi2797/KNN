Prepare a model for glass classification using KNN

table(glass_test_pred,glass_test_labels)
               glass_test_labels
glass_test_pred  1  2  3  5  6  7
              1 19  5  3  0  0  0
              2  4 17  2  2  0  1
              3  0  1  1  0  0  0
              5  0  1  0  2  1  0
              6  0  0  0  2  1  1
              7  0  0  0  0  0  3

Accuracy = 65.15% for k=4
accuracy = 60% for k=6
